This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Webview Example

## Get started:

`yarn install`
`npm run start`

Runs server alongside the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

### `nodemon server/index.js`

Runs the server code.<br>
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.
